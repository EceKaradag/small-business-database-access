# Unique Tattoo Shop – Relational Database (Microsoft Access)

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for a small business scenario: a tattoo shop. The goal was to create a structured, normalized system to manage clients, artists, appointments, and services using Microsoft Access.

The database was built from scratch and focuses on clarity, data integrity, and real-world usability.

## What This Project Includes

- Fully normalized tables (1NF–3NF)
- Primary and foreign keys
- Defined relationships between entities
